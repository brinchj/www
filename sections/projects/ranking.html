<h4>Abstract</h4>
I give a detailed description of how the PageRank method and the Close Rankings method
can be used to rank images in a much more dynamic way than the currently used Average-Point 
method. I show how the Close Rankings method can be used to rank images using
both user rankings and vote relevance.
<br/><br/>
I introduce the Newcomer's Rush scenario and show how all three methods are aected
by this problem. Furthermore I give a workaround that relaxes the eects of Newcomer's
Rush.
<br/><br/>
When researching the PageRank method, I discovered a simple proof that the recursive
computations used to solve the method converge, something that was not in (Page, 1999).
I give a short description of the proof and show that the normalization described in the
pseudocode in (Page, 1999) is unnecessary when dealing with the Random-Surfer model.
<br/><br/>
I show that the Close Rankings method has a problem with the way it compares votes,
which implies that it might go in the complete opposite direction of what was intented
without being punished. I propose a simple change in the objective function of the optimization 
problem which fixes this problem.
<br/><br/>
I show how the problem produced by the Close Rankings method can be solved using
the Subgradient method combined with Golden Section Search.
