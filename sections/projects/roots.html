  <h3>Abstract:</h3>
I investigate the normality of algebraic irrational numbers, specifically by
analyzing their chi^2, nabla^2chi^2 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  distributions.
<br/><br/>
    I analyze 39 Pisot numbers, 47 Salem numbers and the roots of 15 randomly
generated polynomials with integer coefficients, all computed to 5 bases with
a precision of 2 * 3^18 approx 2^29.5 bits (about 233 million
decimals).
<br/><br/>
    I show that the frequencies of the digit sequences tested are equidistributed
with a confidence value of 5%. Specifically, digit sequences of size 10 in bases
2 and 3, size 7 in base 5, size 6 in base 7 and size 5 in base 10 are equally
frequent. This result is true for all 101 numbers. I show that no pattern can
be found in the statistical anomalies and that only few anomalies survive a
prefix size of 2 * 3^18 approx 2^29.5 .
<br/><br/>
    The results lend credence to Borel's conjecture that all algebraic irrationals
are normal in all bases.
<br/><br/>
    Furthermore, popular root finding algorithms are discussed and their per-
formance when computing roots to arbitrary precision compared. Specifically,
I give a comparison of Newton's, Laguerre's and Gupta-Mittal's methods
using MPSolve as reference. The results show that Newton's and Laguerre's
methods are much faster than the competition. Gupta-Mittal is shown to
reduce to the classical Power Method, faster than MPsolve, but much slower
than Newton's and Laguerre's methods. Gupta-Mittal appears to be unsuited,
while Laguerre's method shows great performance.
