<p>&#8220;I have followed Johan Brinch's studies at our department,
having taught two freshman courses where Mr. Brinch was a participant,
as well as supervising him in two graduate projects concerning,
respectively, (i) automatic chord extraction from written music and
statistical analysis thereof, and (ii) computation of roots of
polynomials with integer coefficients to very high precision.

<br/>
<p>Mr. Brinch is a very diligent and ambitious student who pursues his
studies with great stubbornness and curiosity. He easily ranks among
the top 25 per cent of the graduate students at our department, and
has remained devoted to academic achievement throughout his
studies. In addition to his studies, Mr. Brinch is currently serving
as a teaching assistant in a freshman CS course for students of
humanities given by our department.&#8221;
